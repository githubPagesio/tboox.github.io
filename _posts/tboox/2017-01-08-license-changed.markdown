In order to better promote TBOOX open source project development, we decided to adopt a more relaxed, more developer-friendly Apache License 2.0

The [tbox](https://github.com/tboox/tbox) and [xmake](http://www.xmake.io/cn) projects have updated to new license.

If you want to known more, please refer toï¼š[Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/tboox/tbox/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
