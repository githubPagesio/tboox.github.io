We can uses the macro plugin to package all architectures of the given platform.

    # packages targets for all architectures of the current platform
    $xmake macro package 

    # packages targets for all architectures of the iphoneos platform
    $xmake m package -p iphoneos

    # packages targets with debug version for all architectures of the iphoneos platform and output to the directory: /tmp/output
    $xmake m package -p iphoneos -f "-m debug" -o /tmp/output
```
